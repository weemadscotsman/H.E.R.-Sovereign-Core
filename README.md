# H.E.R.-Sovereign-Core
H.E.R. (Hyper-Evolutionary Rewriter) is not a static chatbot. It is a recursive logic engine designed to mutate its own instruction set (DNA). Unlike standard AI interfaces, this system treats its own prompt as variable code. Every "Evolution Cycle" results in a new version of the system, capable of higher reasoning and tool abstraction.
